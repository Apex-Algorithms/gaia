//! Repository interface for actions, user votes, and vote counts data storage.
//!
//! This module defines the `ActionsRepository` trait, which provides a clean abstraction
//! over the underlying data store for the actions indexer system. It handles the persistence
//! and retrieval of:
//!
//! - **Actions**: Processed blockchain actions (e.g., voting actions)
//! - **User Votes**: Individual user voting records with timestamps
//! - **Vote Counts**: Aggregated vote tallies per entity and space
//! - **Changesets**: Atomic batches of related data modifications
//!
//! The trait is designed to support transactional operations and efficient batch processing,
//! making it suitable for high-throughput blockchain data indexing scenarios.

/// Repository interface for managing actions indexer data storage operations.
///
/// This trait defines the contract for data persistence in the actions indexer system.
/// Implementors provide concrete storage backends (e.g., PostgreSQL, MongoDB) that handle:
///
/// - **Batch Operations**: Efficient insertion and updates for high-throughput scenarios
/// - **Transactional Safety**: Atomic operations to maintain data consistency
/// - **Query Operations**: Retrieval of user votes and vote counts with flexible criteria
/// - **Changeset Management**: Coordinated persistence of related data modifications
///
/// All operations are asynchronous to support non-blocking I/O in concurrent environments.
/// Error handling is centralized through `ActionsRepositoryError` for consistent error reporting.
